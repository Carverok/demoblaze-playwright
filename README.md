## 🔧 Customizing the Report in Playwright

To customize the report and run tests across multiple browsers, you can configure the `projects` section in the `playwright.config.ts` file. This section allows you to enable tests for major browsers by uncommenting the relevant blocks.

### 🔧 Steps to Customize the Report

1. Open `playwright.config.ts`.
2. Locate the `projects` section.
3. Uncomment the desired browsers to include them in the test runs.

For example, uncomment the following section to run tests on `chromium`, `firefox`, `webkit`, or mobile devices:

```typescript
/* Configure projects for major browsers */
projects: [
  // {
  //   name: 'chromium',
  //   use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
  // },

  // {
  //   name: 'firefox',
  //   use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] },
  // },

  // {
  //   name: 'webkit',
  //   use: { ...devices['Desktop Safari'] },
  // },

  // /* Test against mobile viewports. */
  // {
  //   name: 'Mobile Chrome',
  //   use: { ...devices['Pixel 5'] },
  // },
  // {
  //   name: 'Mobile Safari',
  //   use: { ...devices['iPhone 12'] },
  // },

  // /* Test against branded browsers. */
  // {
  //   name: 'Microsoft Edge',
  //   use: { ...devices['Desktop Edge'], channel: 'msedge' },
  // },
  {
    name: 'Google Chrome',
    use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'], channel: 'chrome' },
  },
],
```
